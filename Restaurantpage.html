<h2>About the Restaurant</h2>
<p>At JOELTHELAKWATSERO, we’re serving up more than food. In fact, JOELTHELAKWATSERO Famous Adobo is one of our unexpected specialties. Reminiscent of butcher shops back in the day, each slow-smoked, sizzling prime chop measures seven-fingers high. Our signature recipe, that we have perfected for more than four decades, is rubbed with a secret blend of seasonings, cured and roasted on a rotisserie with pecan wood for up to six hours before it’s topped with JOELTHELAKWATSERO signature herb-garlic butter, then carved tableside.</p>
